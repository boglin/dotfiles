Fonts: Powerline fonts are needed for airline/tmuxline
       On ipad OS this is a bit of a pain.
       Use ifont app to produce a profile with the .ttf which can be installed.
       ish requires the font to be marked as monospace to show in the browser.

Black: It is possible for pip and black master to get out of sync.  If this
	   happens and causes problems we can install the latest python module
	   with:
	     pip3 install --upgrade git+https://github.com/psf/black.git
